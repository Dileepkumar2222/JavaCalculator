# Java Method Demo

This Java application demonstrates the use of static and non-static methods with different parameter types and return values. It is designed as a beginner-friendly example to understand method definitions and invocations in Java.

## Description

The program contains a single class with the following methods:

m1(): A non-static method that takes no parameters and returns a long value.
m2(short s): A non-static method that takes a short parameter and returns a float value.
m3(): A static method that takes no parameters and returns a double value.
m4(char c): A static method that takes a char parameter and returns an int value.

All these methods are invoked from the main method, and their return values are printed to the console
